            format. Each color component's range is from 0 to 255.

            @note You probably only want to use this function if you haven't
            previously called elm_bg_file_set(), so that you just want a solid
            color background.

            @note You can reset the color by setting @p r, @p g, @p b as -1, -1, -1.

            background

            @return @c EINA_TRUE on success, @c EINA_FALSE otherwise

            This sets the image file used in the background object. If the
            image comes from an Edje group, it will be stretched to completely
            fill the background object. If it comes from a traditional image file, it
            will by default be centered in this widget's are (thus retaining
            its aspect), what could lead to some parts being not visible. You
            may change the mode of exhibition for a real image file with
            elm_bg_option_set().

            @note Once the image of @p obj is set, a previously set one will be
            deleted, even if @p file is @c NULL.

            @note This will only affect the contents of one of the background's
            swallow spots, namely @c "elm.swallow.background". If you want to
            achieve the @c Layout's file setting behavior, you'll have to call
            that method on this object.

            @warning This function just makes sense if an image file was set on
            @p obj, with elm_bg_file_set().

            This function sets a new size for pixmap representation of the
            given bg image. It allows for the image to be loaded already in the
            specified size, reducing the memory usage and load time (for
            example, when loading a big image file with its load size set to a
            smaller size)

            @note This is just a hint for the underlying system. The real size
            of the pixmap may differ depending on the type of image being
            loaded, being bigger than requested.
