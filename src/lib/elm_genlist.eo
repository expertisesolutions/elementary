            maximum (which increases the performance for scrolling the list).
            In the normal mode, genlist will pre-calculate all the items' sizes even
            though they are not in use. So items' callbacks are called many times than
            expected. But homogeneous mode will skip the item size pre-calculation
            process so items' callbacks are called only when the item is needed.

            @note This also works well with group index.

            the scroller will scroll horizontally. Otherwise items are expanded
            to fill the width of the viewport of the scroller. If it is

         <dl>
            <dt>FNM_NOESCAPE</dt>
            <dd>If this flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary character, instead of an escape character.</dd>
            <dt>FNM_PATHNAME</dt>
            <dd>If this flag is set, match a slash in string only with a slash in pattern and not by an asterisk (*)
                or a question mark (?) metacharacter, nor by a bracket expression ([]) containing a slash.</dd>
            <dt>FNM_PERIOD</dt>
            <dd>If this flag is set, a leading period in string has to be matched exactly by a period in pattern.
                A period is considered to be leading if it is the first character in string, or if both
                FNM_PATHNAME is set and the period immediately follows a slash.</dd>
            <dt>FNM_FILE_NAME</dt>
            <dd>This is a GNU synonym for FNM_PATHNAME.</dd>
            <dt>FNM_LEADING_DIR</dt>
            <dd>If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is considered to be matched if it matches an
                initial segment of string which is followed by a slash. This flag is mainly for the internal
                use of glibc and is only implemented in certain cases.</dd>
            <dt>FNM_CASEFOLD</dt>
            <dd>If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is matched case-insensitively.</dd>
