 * @section elm-layout-class The Elementary Layout Class
 *
 * Elementary, besides having the @ref Layout widget, exposes its
 * foundation -- the Elementary Layout Class -- in order to create
 * other widgets which are, basically, a certain layout with some more
 * logic on top.
 *
 * The idea is to make the creation of that widgets as easy as possible,
 * factorizing code on this common base. For example, a button is a
 * layout (that looks like push button) that happens to react on
 * clicks and keyboard events in a special manner, calling its user
 * back on those events. That's no surprise, then, that the @ref
 * Button implementation relies on #Elm_Layout_Smart_Class, if you go
 * to check it.
 *
 * The Layout class inherits from
 * #Elm_Container_Smart_Class. Container parts, here, map directly to
 * Edje parts from the layout's Edje group. Besides that, there's a whole
 * infrastructure around Edje files:
 * - interfacing by signals,
 * - setting/retrieving text part values,
 * - dealing with table and box parts directly,
 * - etc.
 *
 * Take a look at #Elm_Layout_Smart_Class's 'virtual' functions to
 * understand the whole interface. Finally, layout objects will do
 * <b>part aliasing</b> for you, if you set it up properly. For that,
 * take a look at #Elm_Layout_Part_Alias_Description, where it's
 * explained in detail.

/**
 * @struct _Elm_Layout_Part_Alias_Description
 *
 * Elementary Layout-based widgets may declare part proxies, i.e., aliases
 * for real theme part names to expose to the API calls:
 * - elm_layout_text_set()
 * - elm_layout_text_get()
 * - elm_layout_content_set()
 * - elm_layout_content_get()
 * - elm_layout_content_unset()
 * and their equivalents. This list must be set on the
 * @c "_smart_set_user()" function of inheriting widgets, so that part
 * aliasing is handled automatically for them.
