            For example, freedesktop.org defines standard icon names such as "home",
            "network", etc. There can be different icon sets to match those icon
            keys. The @p name given as parameter is one of these "keys", and will be
            used to look in the freedesktop.org paths and elementary theme. One can
            change the lookup order with elm_icon_order_lookup_set().

            If name is not found in any of the expected locations and it is the
            absolute path of an image file, this image will be used.

            @note The icon image set by this function can be changed by
            elm_image_file_set().

            @note This function does not accept relative icon path.

            If the icon image was set using elm_image_file_set() instead of
